Okay, the user wants me to optimize the code `export { default } from './snap-connect-cell';`. Let me think about what that means.

First, this is an ES6 module export statement. The current line is re-exporting the default export from the specified module. The task is to optimize this code. But how?

Optimization in JavaScript can mean different things: reducing file size, improving performance, or making the code more concise. Since this line is already very short and simple, maybe reducing its length further isn't possible. Wait, maybe there's another way to write a re-export.

The standard way to re-export a default export is using `export { default } from 'module'`, which is exactly what's here. Is there a shorter syntax? Alternatively, you could do `import x from 'module'; export default x;`, but that's two lines and longer in characters.

Wait, perhaps checking if there are any unused exports or other optimizations possible in the project context? But without more context about how this file is used or built (like minification with tools such as Webpack or Terser), it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe using dynamic imports if it's for lazy loading? But that would change behavior and not be an optimization unless needed for performance reasons.

Alternatively, removing unnecessary whitespace? The original line has spaces around curly braces: `{ default }`. According to ES6 syntax rules, spaces inside braces aren't required except between identifiers when they might cause parsing issues. So changing it to `{default}` would still work but save some characters.

So optimizing by removing spaces inside curly braces where allowed could reduce file size slightly.

So changing `export { default } from './snap-connect-cell';` becomes `export{default}from'./snap-connect-cell'`.

Yes! That removes spaces which are not necessary according to ASI rules (Automatic Semicolon Insertion) since operators like '{' and keywords can't be followed by certain tokens here without causing issues otherwise handled by ASI correctly here because no newlines between tokens).

This would make each space character removed save bytes when minifying JS bundles—a common optimization technique applied via tooling automatically during build steps—but perhaps they want manual version of same principle applied directly at source level somehow?

Therefore optimal solution seems being stripping those redundant whitespaces so final optimized version reads:

`export{default}from'./snap-connect-cell';`

That should be valid JS syntax while saving on unnecessary white space usage.

export{default}from'./snap-connect-cell';
